# Code Quiz

This weekâ€™s Challenge is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

When click the start button is clicked, a timer starts and presents a question. Once the question is answered, another question is presented. If the question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the quiz is over. At which point, score and imitials are saved.
